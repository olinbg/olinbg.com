From their [homepage](http://beets.io/):

> Beets is the best command-line tool for viewing, querying, and renaming your music collection

The Github page is [here](https://github.com/beetbox/beets).

I contributed the [beets-spotify](https://github.com/olinbg/beets-spotify) plugin to generate Spotify playlists from tracks in a Beets library.
