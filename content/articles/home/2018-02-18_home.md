I'm an engineer and technical lead at BlackRock.  Find me around the web below or send me [an email](mailto:olin@olinbg.com).

### [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/olinbg)

To chat with me on Linked in, send me a note with the connection request.

### [Github](https://github.com/olinbg)

I don't get as much time for open source as I'd like.  When I am working on things, you'll find the public stuff there.

### [Twitter](https://twitter.com/olinbg)

I'm off and on Twitter, but I'll tweet out occasional musings and follow tech news there.

### [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/olinbg)

You can message me on Facebook and I'll get it eventually (don't check often).
