### Essential Electron - [Link](http://jlord.us/essential-electron/)

Electron is a library for building desktop apps with JavaScript and Node.js.  Think an .exe on windows or packaged app on Mac that you can download an install, but built with web tooling.  This is enabled through an embedded Chrome instance, and is something I'm experimenting with for a new project.

If you're interested in existing Electon apps, I would check out [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - both text editors.

### Apache Spark @ Scale from Facebook - [Link](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1671373793181703/apache-spark-scale-a-60-tb-production-use-case/)

A great read on a couple of levels.  First, real-world usage on huge Spark datasets is something I want to learn more about.  Facebook clearly has the data set size covered.  Also, they contributed a number of changes back to Spark, and posted the specific bug fixes and details.  This means you can deep-dive on anything of interest.  Finally, it seems like a great model of solving an internal problem with the right open-source tools.

### Why You Should Learn Python - [Link](https://iluxonchik.github.io/why-you-should-learn-python/)

I'm a big fan of Python, both in general as a scripting language, and the wealth of libraries that have built.  Even though I'm not necessarily the target audience for this article, there are some great points on why adding it to your toolbox is a great idea.  I think members of my team are still looking for reasons to experiment with it, so hopefully this can provide some encouragement.  I'll also be reading [Fluent Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032519.do) soon as I've seen a couple recommendations for this book recently.

### Angular 2 and Webpack Starter & Class - [Link](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/)

I've been looking for solid Angular 2 resources - given the popularity of Angular 1 and the efforts to clean up and simplify the framework in the second iteration, I want to adopt it for my web projects moving forward.  This link is actually two resources in one that I'll try out - an Angular 2 starter project with a free class you can join that walks through building an app from the ground up.

### Arguments against JSON-driven development - [Link](http://okigiveup.net/arguments-against-json-driven-development/)

I read this as a cautionary tale, given that I'm trying to introduce more JSON-based serialization in my projects.  Although it can make communicating between processes easier, if left unchecked, the style can create the kind of spaghetti code that I'm explicity trying to avoid.  Also, a very quick read.
