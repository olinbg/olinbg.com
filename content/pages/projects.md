Title: Projects

### WSL-Programs

From the [Github page](https://github.com/ethanhs/WSL-Programs):

> A community-powered list of programs that work (and those that don't) on the Windows subsystem for Linux. The official Microsoft repository for filing bugs etc is located here. This repo complements the offical one by providing a quick reference for how well programs run.

I've been testing many commands in Bash for Windows; this list has the latest updates on which commands and tools work.

### beets and beets-spotify

From their [homepage](http://beets.io/):

> Beets is the best command-line tool for viewing, querying, and renaming your music collection

The Github page is [here](https://github.com/beetbox/beets).

I contributed the [beets-spotify](https://github.com/olinbg/beets-spotify) plugin to generate Spotify playlists from tracks in a Beets library.
